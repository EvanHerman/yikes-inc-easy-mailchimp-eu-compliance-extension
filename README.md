#  Zip Lookup for MailChimp

This addon extends the base plugin, [Easy Forms for MailChimp by YIKES](https://github.com/yikesinc/yikes-inc-easy-mailchimp-extender/tree/staging), by creating an additional section to the manage forms page called 'EU Law Compliance'. 

All of the MailChimp forms on your site will then contain a check box below them which will assist you in making your forms compliant with EU laws.
